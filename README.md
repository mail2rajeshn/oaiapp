# Digitize and translate your notes with Azure Cognitive Services and Python 

Welcome to the new learning series focused on Azure Cognitive Services and Python! In the **“Digitize and translate your notes with Azure Cognitive Services and Python”** series, you will explore the built-in capabilities of Azure Computer Vision for optical character recognition and the Azure Translator service and build a simple AI web app using Flask.

You will learn how to build an intelligent web app using Flask and Azure Cognitive Services. By the end o this series you will be able to:

- Use the Computer Vision READ API to extract text from an image.
- Translate text using the Translator service.
- Create a Flask app and call the Azure Cognitive Services from the app.
- Deploy the app to Azure App Service.
